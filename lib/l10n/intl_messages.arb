  },
  "answer_2": "Other DEXs generally only allow you to trade assets that are based on a single blockchain network, use proxy tokens, and only allow placing a single order with the same funds.\n\nAtomicDEX enables you to natively trade across two different blockchain networks without proxy tokens. You can also place multiple orders with the same funds. For example, you can sell 0.1 BTC for KMD, QTUM, or VRSC — the first order that fills automatically cancels all other orders.",

  "question_3": "How long does each atomic swap take?",
  "@question_3": {
    "type": "text",
    "placeholders": {}
  },
  "answer_3": "Several factors determine the processing time for each swap. The block time of the traded assets depends on each network (Bitcoin typically being the slowest) Additionally, the user can customize security preferences. For example, you can ask AtomicDEX to consider a KMD transaction as final after just 3 confirmations which makes the swap time shorter compared to waiting for a <a href=\"https://komodoplatform.com/security-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow/\">notarization</a>.",

  "question_4": "Do I need to be online for the duration of the swap?",
  "@question_4": {
    "type": "text",
    "placeholders": {}
  },
  "answer_4": "Yes. You must remain connected to the internet and have your app running to successfully complete each atomic swap (very short breaks in connectivity are usually fine). Otherwise, there is risk of trade cancellation if you are a maker, and risk of loss of funds if you are a taker. The atomic swap protocol requires both participants to stay online and monitor the involved blockchains for the process to stay atomic.",

  "question_5": "How are the fees on atomicDEX calculated?",
  "@question_5": {
    "type": "text",
    "placeholders": {}
  },
  "answer_5": "There are two fee categories to consider when trading on AtomicDEX.\n\n1. AtomicDEX charges approximately 0.13% (1/777 of trading volume but not lower than 0.0001) as the trading fee for taker orders, and maker orders have zero fees.\n\n2. Both makers and takers will need to pay normal network fees to the involved blockchains when making atomic swap transactions.\n\nNetwork fees can vary greatly depending on your selected trading pair.",
